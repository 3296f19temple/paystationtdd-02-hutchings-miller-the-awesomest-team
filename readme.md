#####Paul Hutchings
I began with configuring the IntelliJ project and adding JUnit so that we could run the tests. I created a test, watched it fail, then pushed to github for Liam to implement. He then created a test for me to implement and we went back and forth until all of the tests were complete and had passed. I also created the initial blank readme file for Liam and I to complete.
